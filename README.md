## What is a bookmarklet?

### Answer

A bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript code that can be saved as a bookmark in your web browser. When you click on the bookmark, the associated JavaScript code is executed on the current page. Bookmarklets are often used to extend the functionality of a webpage, modify its appearance, or perform specific actions such as hacks that alter the value in your statistics.

### Installing

* How/where to use/download this
* There are no downloads needed! It's simple, Just copy any of the scripts. And then bookmark any random site and press More/Edit (whichever one) than paste the script into the URL section. Of the edit bookmark page.

### ANY OTHER BOOKMARKLETS NOT FROM ME

* ONLY .HTML, .ZIP or .RAR files are trusted. Anything that are not those IS A VIRUS
* ⬇️⬇️
```
BOOKMARKLETS SHOULD NOT BE INSTALLED, IF YOU GET ONE. MAKE SURE THERE IS A .HTML FILE THATS IT. YOU MIGHT FIND A (.ZIP or .RAR) FILE IF NOT, ITS A VIRUS
